1998 to 2001 or so I was working at Left Field Productions in Westlake Village,
California doing color gameboy programming. I was co-developer on:

Kobe Bryant 3 on 3
Beauty And The Beast: A Boardgame Adventure

I was sole developer on:
Little Mermaid II Pinball Frenzy
Thrillride Pinball

There was some interest in archiving source and data for these ancient gaming
machines so I dug it out and got it all to build on a modern recent linux
OS (I use ubuntu 18.04 LTS).

You'd just do

make

in this directory and hopefully everything will build.
The emulator I wrote is in the mgb/ directory and it uses SDL 1.x. If you do

make play

in this directory after a successful build it should launch the emulator with
the merm.gb image.


The keyboard keys are tuned for the pinball game.

Left + Right shift are flippers
A is start
Arrow keys do something
Z does something (push the table right)
/ does something (push the table left)
space does something (push the table up)

The emulator was used for development, it's much more convenient than an
actual color gameboy.
