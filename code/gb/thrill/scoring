---- Warps ----
A warp is a term used in this document to mean completing the table. The
warp counter starts out at 0, and increases by 1 each time the table is
completed. The warp counter is shown on the high score table.

---- Bonus ----
The bonus multiplier has a maximum value of 250. The design spec called for
an unlimited multiplier but I think this is a reasonable compromise. Large
numbers are hard to deal with on this 8 bit machine.

The bonus value increases as follows:
 2,000 for any ramp or loop
 5,000 for each thrill point (1 letter of THRILLRIDE)
10,000 for each brass ring
15,000 for each ride photo

The bonus value has a maximum value of 99,999,000. Once this value is reached,
it will stay there and not wrap around to 0.

---- Skill shot ----
After ball launch, skill shot is possible for 5 seconds.
Left ramp, right ramp and snackbar are normal skill shot. Value starts at
50,000 and increases by 10,000 for each normal skill shot.
Left loop and right loop are super skill shot. Value starts at
150,000 and increases by 50,000 for each super skill shot.
Both skill shots advance bonus multiplier 4x.
Skill shot is indicated by yellow arrows for normal and red arrows for super.

---- snack bar items ----
Match 50 listed items exactly in name + score
The following are too long for our line of text.
   HERSHEY'S MILK CHOCOLATE BAR WITH ALMONDS
   HERSHEY'S COOKIES 'N' CREME
   REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER CUPS
   HERSHEY'S MILK CHOCOLATE BAR

---- Hide and seek mode ----
Starts after 50 snack bar treats collected.
7 objects each are associated with a ramp, scoop or loop. They appear
in random order (except the cow at the snackbar is always last). After hitting
the appropriate target, the ball must be shot into the snackbar to score.
First scores 100k, second 200k, third 300k, etc. There is no time limit between
hitting the first target and getting the ball into the snackbar.

---- Wild cat roller coaster multiball ----
Jackpot base is 100,000. Hitting either bottom pop increases it by 2,000.
Hitting a blue top pop increases it by 2,000, a green by 5,000, and an
orange by 10,000.

Lock is lit by hitting all 3 CAT targets. Ball is locked by the upper left
scoop. When 3 balls locked, 3 balls are shot out of the snack bar to start
the multiball. Single, double and triple jackpots are collected at the left
ramp. The super jackpot is collected at the right ramp.

To complete the multiball, you must get enough jackpots. Easy, medium and hard
require 7,9,11 jackpots respectively. Single, double, triple and super jackpots
count as 1,2,3 and 5 respectively. With this mechanism the player can complete
the multiball in several attempts. Each warp adds 2 more jackpots to the
requirement.

On medium and hard difficulty the jackpot must be re-enabled by shooting
the snackbar and left loop, respectively. On easy difficulty the jackpot is
always enabled.

Snackbar awards exist to increase the jackpot value by 25k and 50k.
After collecting jackpot, it is reset to 100,000. Maximum jackpot value is
1,999,000.

---- Log flume multiball ----
Jackpot base is 100,000. Each spinner revolution increases the jackpot by 5,000
throughout the game. Lock is lit by doing 3 right ramps. Ball is
locked by the upper right scoop. When 3 balls locked, 3 balls are shot out
of the snack bar to start the multiball. Single, double and triple jackpots
are collected at the right ramp. The super jackpot is collected at the left
ramp. For this multiball balls may be locked in the left and right scoops, if
at least 2 balls are in play. Hitting the snackbar will lock the ball if either
left or right is free and there are at least 2 balls in play. If one ball is
locked, the jackpot will be at least a double. If two balls are locked, the
jackpot will be at least a triple. Locked balls are ejected after 15 seconds,
after collecting any jackpot, or if any ball is lost.

To complete the multiball, you must get enough jackpots. Easy, medium and hard
require 7,9,11 jackpots respectively. Single, double, triple and super jackpots
count as 1,2,3 and 5 respectively. With this mechanism the player can complete
the multiball in several attempts. Each warp adds 2 more jackpots to the
requirement.

On medium and hard difficulty the jackpot must be re-enabled by shooting
the snackbar and right loop, respectively. On easy difficulty the jackpot is
always enabled.

Snackbar awards exist to increase the jackpot value by 25k and 50k.
After collecting jackpot, it is reset to 100,000.

Timer is initially 30, but increases by 5 after each time, a maximum of 99.
There is a 12guage indicator with 12 lights. When all 12 lights are lit,
they go off and another letter of THRILLRIDE is lit. When all 10

Each spinner adds to the kickback power level. When the kickback power is
full, the kickback is lit.

On easy, the kickback is always lit and the power level is always full.
On medium, the kickback starts lit but is lost after use, and must be recharged.
On hard, the kickback starts off, must be recharged, and is lost when used.
   In addition, the power level drains away slowly unless it is full.
