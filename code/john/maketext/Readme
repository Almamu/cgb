Not sure how the files in this directory are used. The maketext tool is
used elsewhere though.

The issue is mainly for Japanese text. There are only a small number of
all the glyphs that have been drawn, specifically those needed for the
messages that appear in the game. The Japanese translators provide Japanese
text and then this has to get mapped to glyphs that exist in the game. If
they use any characters that don't exist we need to find out before the
game goes to production.

So we have the japanese.u16 file which is a list of known good glyphs that
can be used since their artwork exists. Any text that tries to use a
character that isn't available must generate an error.

In the case of producing the all.b2b which is the US/Euro version with 5
languages there are no missing glyphs. Producing the fullengl2.txt reports
missing characters.

I'm not sure if these files are even used though. The maketext tool is the
primary export, I think.
